# Sbeve-Sbot

A Discord bot that responds with "AW MAN" whenever someone says "CREEPER."

## Naming of the bot

The originally intended name for this bot is Minecraft Steve Bot.

However, I used "Sbeve" because:

- I drew inspiration from the "s(he) be(lie)ve(d)" meme
- The letter "B" is superior to the letter "T"

The "S" in "Sbot" is added for consistency.
